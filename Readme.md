# Exploratory Data Analysis - Course Project 1

### Background
This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on the course web site:
.Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]
.Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

### Assignment
Construction of 4 plots, each of which reads in the data file and create a plot to an external device

### How to run
1. For each script file ( Plot1.R, Plot2.R, Plot3.R, Plot4.R) define the path for the working directory (symbol is ff)
2. Each script is set up to read the input data from the working directory ( ie, place the input in the working directory)
3. source each script file to run. The resulting script will be created in the working directory
